Let's get started by firing up Node.js. Click on the black block below to execute the command.

`node --use-strict`{{execute}}

Load the helper code. Again, click on the black block below.

`const steps = require('./steps.js')`{{execute}}

Now it's your turn. 

An expression is made up of literals, variables, operators, and function calls. Every expression has a *value*. 

The Node interpreter computes and displays the values of any expressions that you provide. Try this one:

`6 * 7`{{execute}}

A statement (assignment, branch, loop, and so on) is executed for its *effect*. Statements don't have values. Here is a typical statement:

`let number = 6 * 7;`{{execute}}

What happens when you run the statement? Of course, `number` is set to the value of the expression on the right hand side of the `=` operator. That's the effect. And then Node feels compelled to display a value. Click on the black box if you haven't already to see what it is.

This is an oddity of Node. REPLs (read-evaluate-print loops) of other programming languages don't print anything when you enter a statement. Unless, of course, the statement happens to be a print statement.

Let's try that:

`console.log(6 * 7);`{{execute}}

You observe the *side effect* of the statement, followed by a printout of the value that Node ascribes to it. For statements, you can ignore those values. To see why, try this statement:

`while (number > 10) number--;`;{{execute}}

What did Node print? Was it useful? Forget that you ever saw this ðŸ˜‚

In many languages it is simple to distinguish expressions and statements. Statements always end in semicolons. In JavaScript, it's not as simple, as you will see in the next step.

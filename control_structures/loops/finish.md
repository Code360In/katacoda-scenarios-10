If you are familiar with Java, C or C++, you now know everything about JavaScript control structures. JavaScript has the same if, switch, while, do/while, continue, and break statements as all languages that are derived from C. The only differences are the "for of" and "for in" loops. 

For more details on loops, visit the "Modern JavaScript for the Impatient" [book](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/modern-javascript-for/9780136502166/ch02.xhtml#ch02lev1sec10) or [video](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/modern-javascript-for/9780135812778/9780135812778-MJSI_01_02_04).

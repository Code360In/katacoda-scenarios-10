Let's get started by firing up Node.js. Click on the black block below to execute the command.

`node --use-strict`{{execute}}

Load the helper code. Again, click on the black block below.

`const steps = require('./steps.js')`{{execute}}

Now it's your turn. 

Declare a variable `counter` that holds a number.

Simply type your declaration into the terminal and hit Enter. 

When you are done, check your result. Click on the black block below:

`steps.test1(counter)`{{execute}}

In JavaScript, a variable does not have a type. You can store values of any type in any variable. 

Next, change `counter` to hold a string. Again, type your statement and hit Enter.

When you are done, check your result:

`steps.test2(counter)`{{execute}}

*NOTE:* In modern JavaScript, you should use the `let` keyword to declare variables. Don't use the `var` keyword.  Katacoda can't check how you declare a variable, so it's up to you to do the right thing.

Simply put the two variable names in braces to the left of `=`, and the object to be destructured to the right:

```let { day, month } = firstMoonLanding```{{execute}}

A numeric prefix is parsed, and everything after the number is ignored. Even spaces before the number are fine. Try out:

```parseFloat(' 3 pies')```{{execute}}

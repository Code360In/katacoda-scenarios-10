You can make a JavaScript array shorter by deleting elements at the end. Create an array:

```let c = steps.pidigits()
console.log(c)```{{execute}}

Now change `c` so that the last element is removed. You can do this without using loops or calling methods. 

When you are done, check your result:

`steps.test3(c)`{{execute}}

If you don't initialize a variable, it is set to the special value `undefined`. Go ahead and define a variable `enigma` without initializing it.

Run this code to check your work.

`steps.test3(enigma)`{{execute}}

This is not something you commonly do, but it can happen if the variable is set to different values in an `if` statement.

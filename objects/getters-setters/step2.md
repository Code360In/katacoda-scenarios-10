In the editor to the right, click on Person2.js and look at the code. Pay attention to the `fullName` method with the `set` prefix.

To run the code, click on the black block below:

`node Person2.js`{{execute}}

1. Which method is called in line 12? Which method is called in line 13?
2. How does JavaScript know when to call the `get` method and when to call the `set` method?
3. Make the `set` method into a regular method by removing `set`. What else do you need to change?

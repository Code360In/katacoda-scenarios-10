Let's get started by firing up Node.js:

`node`{{execute}}

Load the helper code:

`const steps = require('./steps.js')`{{execute}}

Now it's your turn. An array in JavaScript (unlike a Java array) can hold elements of any type. 

Declare an array `a` of length 3 that contains a number, a string, and a Boolean value.

When you are done, check your result:

`steps.test1(a)`{{execute}}

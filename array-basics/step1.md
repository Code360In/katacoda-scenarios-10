An array in JavaScript is ...

Let's get started by firing up Node.js:

`node`{{execute}}

Load the helper code:

`const step1 = require('./step1.js')`{{execute}}

Now it's your turn. Define an array `a` of length 3 that contains a number, a string, and a Boolean value.

When you are done, check your result:

`step1.test1(a)`{{execute}}
